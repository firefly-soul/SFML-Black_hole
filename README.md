# SFML-Black_hole
This is a simple simulation of a black hole based on CodingTrain challenges.

The simulation follows real physics gravitation formulas.

There are 2 global consts called G and c.
The Blackhole class constructor accepts 2 parameters: Vector2f position, float mass.
Feel free to play with these values.
